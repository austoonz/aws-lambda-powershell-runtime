# Demo-runtime-layer-function

Initial demo application [demo-runtime-layer-function](examples/demo-runtime-layer-function/) uses AWS SAM to deploy the following:

1. PowerShell custom runtime based on ````provided.al2```` as a Lambda layer.
2. Additional Lambda layer including the [AWSTools for PowerShell](https://aws.amazon.com/powershell/) with the following module.
    * ````AWS.Tools.Common````
3. Both layers store their Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) as parameters in [AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/systems-manager-parameter-store.html) which can be referenced in other templates
4. Lambda function with three different handler options.

To build the custom runtime and the AWS Tools for PowerShell layer for this example, AWS SAM uses a Makefile. This downloads the specified version of [PowerShell](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/releases/) and select modules from the [AWSTools](https://sdk-for-net.amazonwebservices.com/ps/v4/latest/AWS.Tools.zip)

Windows does not natively support Makefiles. When using Windows, you can use either [Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/about), [Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) or native PowerShell.

## Pre-requisites

* [AWS Serverless Application Model (AWS SAM)](https://aws.amazon.com/serverless/sam/)
* If building on Windows:
  * [Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/about) *or*
  * [Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) *or*
  * [PowerShell for Windows](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell-on-windows)

Clone the repository and change into the example directory

```shell
git clone https://github.com/awslabs/aws-lambda-powershell-runtime
cd aws-lambda-powershell-runtime/examples/demo-runtime-layer-function
```

Use one of the *"Build"* options, A,B,C, depending on your operating system and tools.

## A) Build using Linux or WSL

Build the custom runtime, Lambda layer, and function packages using native Linux or WSL.

```shell
sam build --parallel
```

![sam build --parallel](../../img/sam-build-parallel.png)

## B) Build using Docker

You can build the custom runtime, Lambda layer, and function packages using Docker. This uses a Linux-based Lambda-like Docker container to build the packages. Use this option for Windows without WSL or as an isolated Mac/Linux build environment.

```shell
sam build --parallel --use-container
```

![sam build --parallel --use-container](/img/sam-build-parallel-use-container.png)

## C) Build using PowerShell for Windows

You can use native PowerShell for Windows to download and extract the custom runtime and Lambda layer files. This performs the same file copy functionality as the Makefile. It adds the files to the source folders rather than a build location for subsequent deployment with AWS SAM. Use this option for Windows without WSL or Docker.

```shell
.\build-layers.ps1
```

![.\build-layers.ps1](/img/build-layers.png)

## Test the function locally

Once the build process is complete, you can use AWS SAM to test the function locally.

```shell
sam local invoke
```

This uses a Lambda-like environment to run the function locally and returns the function response, which is the result of `Get-AWSRegion`.

## Deploying to the AWS Cloud

Use AWS SAM to deploy the resources to your AWS account. Run a guided deployment to set the default parameters for the first deploy.

```shell
sam deploy -g
```

For subsequent deployments you can use `sam deploy`.

Enter a **Stack Name** and accept the remaining initial defaults.

![sam deploy -g](/img/sam-deploy-g.png)

AWS SAM deploys the infrastructure and outputs the details of the resources.

### View, edit, and invoke the function in the AWS Management Console

You can view, edit code, and invoke the Lambda function in the Lambda Console.

Navigate to the *Functions* page and choose the function specified in the `sam deploy` *Outputs*.

Using the built-in [code editor](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/foundation-console.html#code-editor), you can view the function code.

This function imports the ````AWS.Tools.Common```` module during the init process. The function handler runs and returns the output of ````Get-AWSRegion````.

![lambda-console-code](/img/lambda-console-code.png)

To invoke the function, select the **Test** button and create a test event. For more information on invoking a function with a test event, see the [documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/getting-started-create-function.html#get-started-invoke-manually).

You can see the results in the *Execution result* pane.

You can also view a snippet of the generated *Function Logs* below the *Response*. View the full logs in [Amazon CloudWatch Logs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/logs). You can navigate directly via the *Monitor* tab.

## Invoke the function using the AWS CLI

From a command prompt, invoke the function. Amend the `--function-name` and `--region` values for your function. This should return `"StatusCode": 200` for a successful invoke.

````shell
aws lambda invoke --function-name "aws-lambda-powershell-runtime-Function-6W3bn1znmW8G" --region us-east-1 invoke-result
````

View the function results which are outputted to `invoke-result`.

````shell
cat invoke-result
````

![cat-invoke-result.png](/img/cat-invoke-result.png)

## Invoke the function using the AWS Tools for PowerShell

You can invoke the Lambda function using the AWS Tools for PowerShell and capture the response in a variable. The response is available in the `Payload` property of the `$result` object which can be read using the .NET `StreamReader` class.

````shell
$Response = Invoke-LMFunction -FunctionName aws-lambda-powershell-runtime-PowerShellFunction-HHdKLkXxnkUn -LogType Tail
[System.IO.StreamReader]::new($Response.Payload).ReadToEnd()
````

This outputs the result of `AWS-GetRegion`

## Cleanup

To delete the AWS resources created, run the following and confirm that you want to delete the resources that were created by this template.

````shell
sam delete
````
